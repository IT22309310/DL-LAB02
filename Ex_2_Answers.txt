1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

When hidden nodes increase, the network has more capacity to learn complex patterns.

With very few hidden nodes, the model underfits (low accuracy).

With more hidden nodes, accuracy usually improves up to a point.

If too many hidden nodes are added, the model may start to overfit (memorize training data instead of generalizing).

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

At low hidden units (1–3), the model is too simple and cannot capture non-linear decision boundaries, therefore accuracy is low.

As hidden units increase moderately (5–20), the model captures more complex relationships and accuracy improves.

At very high hidden units (50+), accuracy may plateau or even fluctuate due to overfitting and noise sensitivity.

So the pattern is: low (Underfitting) > improves > stabilizes > overfitting
